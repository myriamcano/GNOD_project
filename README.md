%% Introduction
You have joined Gnod as a Data Analyst, tasked with enhancing their music recommendations feature. Gnod, a platform offering collaborative filtering-based recommendations for music, art, literature, and products, seeks to improve its music recommender at www.gnoosic.com. Users input three preferred bands, and the system recommends similar bands based on collaborative filtering algorithms.

Gnod, a growing company, is exploring additional revenue streams, including potential partnerships with music apps. Your role is crucial in expanding and refining their recommendation capabilities.

%%Challenge
Your initial task, assigned by Jane (CTO of Gnod), involves researching and exploring new data sources for songs. The objective is to enhance the music recommendation system by incorporating song recommendations based on acoustic similarity and global popularity.

%%Task Overview

Explore the internet for relevant data sources on popular songs. You can use APIs or web scraping to gather information. While the long-term goal is to collect data from millions of songs, start with a manageable subset to assess feature usefulness.


Once the data is collected, create clusters of songs with similar characteristics. The goal is to prioritize recommendations from the same cluster when a user inputs a song from a specific group.


On Friday, present your findings to Jane and Marek, the CEO. Emphasize the potential of the song recommender and be persuasive in your approach. Jane has a personal interest in this initiative, making it a critical aspect of your role.


Be open-minded and agile in your process. Define products and features as you go, exploring available tools and data. Provide your vision for the product and suggest the next steps based on your analysis.


Wish you luck and strength in your first week at Gnod. Your contribution to the song recommender project is pivotal, and your insights will play a key role in shaping Gnod's future recommendations.

Jane, CTO of Gnod
